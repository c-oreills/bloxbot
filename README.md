Bloxbot [prevents child labour](https://www.c-oreills.com/2022/01/11/free-to-play-child-labour-and-automation.html) by automatically earning currency in a popular children's game.

I built it because my 10 year old neice said "My new year's resolution is to spend 50 minutes a day serving burgers so I have enough money to build stuff". I admired her work ethic but feared her childhood was being poured down the drain.

It uses OpenCV to recognise orders from customers and the corresponding items on the till. It's batteries-not-included (no reference images) to discourage wider use. The piece I'm most proud of is that it's speficially architected to not have a childhood to waste.

I used its ill-gotten gains to start an imaginary fashion design company. Now my neice has her dream job and earns currency by creating fashion designs for [client briefs](https://inktober.com/rules).
